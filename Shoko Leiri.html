            <h1> Who is Shoko Leiri?</h1>
            <h3> 
                Shoko leiri (家いえ入いり硝しょう子こ leiri Shōko?) is a character in the Jujutsu Kaisen series. She is an alumna of Tokyo Jujutsu High, having been classmates with Satoru Gojo and Suguru Geto. After graduating into a full-fledged jujutsu sorcerer, Shoko became the school's primary doctor.
            </h3>
            <h3> 
                Shoko is a very laid-back and nonchalant person, especially compared to Kiyotaka liichi's high- strung attitude and the overly playful Satoru. As a student alongside Satoru and Suguru, she would let the two fight and simply remove herself from the situation as it escalated. She teased and bantered with them as friends during their time at Jujutsu High.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                Shoko didn't appear to take any situation very seriously in general during her Jujutsu High years. She would openly smoke in public despite obviously being a high-schooler and this habit continued with her into adulthood. Even after Suguru went rogue, Shoko was able to have a casual conversation with him about what he did. She was totally comfortable asking Suguru about the accusations and even called him childish for sulking because no one understands him. She even called Satoru to come to confront Suguru right in front of him without any fear for her own life.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                As the school doctor, Shoko appears to take her job seriously and performs in a very stoic manner. While Satoru was visibly upset about Yuji Itadori's demise, Shoko kept her personal feelings out of the situation and only wanted to perform an autopsy, noting that Satoru was being more emotional than usual. It's implied that Shoko has attempted to kick her smoking habit many times but the stress of her job as a healer likely makes it more difficult. She claimed that she was "nostalgic about her highschool days" when it was noticed she was smoking again in Shibuya.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                PS: Shoko is always left out so out the door you go SatoSugu.
